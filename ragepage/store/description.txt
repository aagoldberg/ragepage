RageCheck - Detect Rage Bait Before You Engage

Stop falling for rage bait. RageCheck instantly analyzes social media posts and tells you if content is designed to make you angry for engagement.

HOW IT WORKS

RageCheck adds a "Check" button to posts on your favorite social media platforms. Click it to get an instant rage score (0-100) that shows how likely a post is engineered to provoke anger.

The score breaks down five key manipulation signals:
- Emotional Arousal: Language designed to trigger strong feelings
- Enemy Construction: Creating an "us vs. them" narrative
- Moral Outrage: Exploiting your sense of right and wrong
- False Urgency: Pressuring you to react immediately
- Tribal Signaling: Appealing to group identity
